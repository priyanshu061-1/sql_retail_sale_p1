üõí Retail Sales Analysis
This project focuses on analyzing retail sales data using SQL to derive actionable business insights. The dataset includes transaction-level details such as product category, customer demographics, sales amount, and transaction date and time.

üìå Objectives
The goal of this analysis is to answer key business questions such as:

Which months and categories perform best?

What are customer behavior patterns by age, gender, and category?

Who are the top customers?

How do transaction times affect sales?

üîç Key Analysis Queries & Their Purpose
1. Transactions on a Specific Date
We want to extract all transactions that occurred on November 5, 2022. This can help us analyze sales activity on a given day, for example, to assess the effect of a special event or promotion.

2. High-Activity Clothing Buyers in November 2022
We identify customers who:

Bought items in the "Clothing" category

Made more than 10 transactions

Did so specifically in November 2022

This helps find highly engaged customers within a specific product category and time frame.

3. Total Sales by Product Category
Summarizing total sales for each category shows us which product lines are most profitable. This is essential for inventory planning and marketing focus.

4. Average Age of Beauty Product Buyers
By calculating the average age of customers who purchased beauty items, we can better understand the target demographic for that category. This insight can inform branding and targeted advertising.

5. Transactions with High Sales Value
Filtering for transactions where the total sale exceeded $1,000 helps identify high-value purchases. These may come from premium products or bulk orders and can guide customer segmentation strategies.

6. Gender-wise Transaction Count by Category
Counting the number of transactions made by each gender in each category helps uncover consumer behavior patterns. For instance, it may reveal that women purchase more in the "Beauty" category while men prefer "Electronics".

7. Monthly Average Sales
By calculating the average sales per month, we can detect seasonal trends. For example, sales might spike during holiday months, which is important for campaign planning.

8. Best-Selling Month
This identifies the month with the highest total sales overall. Retailers often use this information to evaluate promotional effectiveness or plan for peak periods.

9. Top 5 Customers
We rank customers based on their total spending. Knowing who your top customers are can help in creating loyalty programs or sending exclusive offers.

10. Unique Customer Count by Category
Counting how many unique customers bought from each category shows which products have the widest appeal. This can also help assess brand or category penetration.

11. Classify Transactions by Time of Day
We create a new column that classifies each transaction as occurring in the Morning, Afternoon, or Evening based on the time of purchase. This helps us understand when customers are most active and could support staffing or ad scheduling decisions.

üìà What You‚Äôll Learn
By the end of this analysis, you will understand:

Customer segmentation by category and demographics

Revenue distribution across time, category, and customer base

Sales trends that support strategic business decisions
